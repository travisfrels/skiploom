Think about: $ARGUMENTS

1. Determine whether the actions truly followed objective best practices.
   - If yes, state that no change is recommended and explain why.
   - If no, explain the specific deficiencies, naming anti-patterns explicitly.
2. Identify specific successes, failures, and opportunities for improvement.

## Output Format

- **Successes** → What Went Well
- **Failures** → What Went Wrong + root-cause table (Issue | Root Cause | Category)
- **Opportunities** → Recommendations
