description: Assess the given alternatives and identify the one that is objectively most viable. Used in tandem with the design skill.

Think about the following alternatives and identify the most viable: $ARGUMENTS

Evaluate each alternative against these criteria, in order of precedence:
- **Impact**: How significantly does it address the problem? Does it deliver meaningful, observable value?
- **Least astonishment**: Does it behave as an informed developer would expect? Does it avoid surprising side effects or non-obvious behavior?
- **Idiomaticity**: Does it follow the conventions, patterns, and idioms of the language, framework, and codebase?

1. Score each alternative against the three criteria using High / Medium / Low. Present scores in a markdown table with criteria as rows and alternatives as columns.
2. Identify the most viable alternative and justify the selection.
3. List alternatives not chosen and justify their rejection.
