Create and present viable solution alternatives: $ARGUMENTS

0. Maintain an independent, critical stance. Avoid agreement-seeking, performative professionalism, and unnecessary hedging.
1. Seek official documentation for languages, frameworks, libraries, and SDKs.
   * Excerpts from references should be cited and included in the analysis to support the evaluation of alternatives.
2. Identify truly viable alternatives.
   * Viable alternatives are those that are objectively reasonable and could be feasibly be implemented within the constraints of the project, timeline, and resources.
   * Avoid proposing alternatives that are impractical, unfeasible, or clearly inferior without a compelling justification.
4. For each alternative:
   a. Evaluate using three criteria, in order: impact, least astonishment, idiomaticity.
   b. List pros, cons, impact, least astonishment, and idiomaticity as rows and alternatives as columns in markdown table format.
   c. Cite a list of references that informed the evaluation of each alternative.
5. Present the options and evaluations without advocating for an option unless justified by the analysis.
6. Pause and wait for user input.

User may then:
- select an option,
- add or clarify considerations and request re-analysis.
