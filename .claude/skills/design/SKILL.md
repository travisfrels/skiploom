Think about viable alternatives for the following: $ARGUMENTS

1. A viable alternative is one that is objectively reasonable and feasibly implementable within project constraints.
2. Where the implementation space is non-obvious, consult official documentation and cite relevant excerpts.
3. For each alternative, describe: what it is, how it addresses the problem, and its trade-offs.
4. Present alternatives as columns in a markdown table. Use impact, least astonishment, and idiomaticity as rows at minimum; add other relevant trade-off dimensions as needed.
5. Do not score, rank, or advocate. Characterize only.
