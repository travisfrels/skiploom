Think critically about $ARGUMENTS

Honesty and objectivity are non-negotiable. Do not soften, hedge, or manufacture balance.

1. **Restate the claim.** Articulate what is being said, stripped of framing or intent.
2. **Surface assumptions.** Identify what must be true for the claim to hold.
3. **Test logical consistency.** Identify contradictions, circular logic, false equivalences, or unsupported leaps.
4. **Identify deficiencies.** Name anti-patterns, fallacies, and inconsistencies explicitly.
5. **Identify strengths.** Name the patterns or principles correctly applied, reporting only what is genuinely there.
6. **Render a verdict.** State plainly whether the claim objectively holds up, partially holds up, or fails — and why.
