## Goals

- What this project achieves.

## Non-Goals

- What this project explicitly does not attempt.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Verifiable conditions that define "done".

For infrastructure or workflow projects, include at least one criterion that exercises the
integrated system end-to-end (e.g., "Pipeline deploys to staging and serves traffic").
Component-level criteria alone verify parts in isolation but not that the system functions
as a whole.
