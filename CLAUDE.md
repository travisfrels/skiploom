Skiploom is a recipe management system.

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: Source Code
- `docs/`: Documentation

## Testing

Code changes follow TDD (Test-Driven Development): write a failing test, implement the minimum code to pass, then refactor. This applies to all backend and frontend code changes. Configuration, documentation, and infrastructure changes that have no testable behavior are exempt.
